### Charlie Hall

This project creates a simple web browser extension on Google Chrome. It displays a simple UI that users can click to rank the wikipedia document:

# Next steps:
- Creating a system to confirm consent from users to use data from wikipedia
- Access and store data on (possibly) their age, gender, race, and current level of education
- A backend system to store the wikipedia data in one localized place
- Frontend send to that system (semi-constructured, but no current backend system to send to)
